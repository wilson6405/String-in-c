# Intriduction
Recall and practice the manipulation of strings and memory buffers in c.

I use "safestringlib" the C library which prevent buffer overflows, string format attacks, conversion overflows/underflows, etc.

For more detail here is the github link: https://github.com/intel/safestringlib

# TODO
* Maybe can do the perfermance test?
