# Intriduction
Recall and practice the manipulation of strings and memory buffers in c.

I use the C library  "safestringlib"which prevent buffer overflows, string format attacks, conversion overflows/underflows, etc.

Otherwises, I use googletest to rewrite the unittests which is in safestringlib.

For more detail here is the github link: 
* [safestringlib](https://github.com/intel/safestringlib)
* [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)

# TODO
* Import Cmake.
* Maybe can do the perfermance test? How?
* PR sprintf_s() and sscanf_s()
